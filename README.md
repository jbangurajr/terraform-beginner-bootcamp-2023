**TerraTowns** is a community website where terraformers launch their own Terra House (user-created website).

Our main objectives were to create, test, and deploy a custom Terraform provider using HashiCorp's structured language (HCL) and Go. Afterwards, AWS Cloudfront and S3 were utilized to host a Static Website. 

Other languages utilized included HTML and Ruby along with Shell scripting. 

Refactoring, testing, and documentation were vital throughout the project along with GitOps and good version control practices.
